## The functions below inverse a square matrix. 
## To avoid recalculating the matrix inverse, the cached matrix would be returened 
## in case the original matrix hasn't changed and that the matrix inverse was already calculated

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
